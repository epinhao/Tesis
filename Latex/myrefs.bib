  title = {A Stochastic Model for Order Book Dynamics},
  journal = {Operations Research},

  abstract = {We propose a continuous-time stochastic model for the dynamics of
	a limit order book. The model strikes a balance between three desirable
	features: it can be estimated easily from data, it captures key empirical
	properties of order book dynamics, and its analytical tractability
	allows for fast computation of various quantities of interest without
	resorting to simulation. We describe a simple parameter estimation
	procedure based on high-frequency observations of the order book
	and illustrate the results on data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	Using simple matrix computations and Laplace transform methods, we
	are able to efficiently compute probabilities of various events,
	conditional on the state of the order book: an increase in the midprice,
	execution of an order at the bid before the ask quote moves, and
	execution of both a buy and a sell order at the best quotes before
	the price moves. Using high-frequency data, we show that our model
	can effectively capture the short-term dynamics of a limit order
	book. We also evaluate the performance of a simple trading strategy
	based on our results.},
